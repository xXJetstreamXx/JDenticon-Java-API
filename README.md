# JDenticon Java API (JDJA)

Identicons are images that are generated for users of websites and programs that are unique for the given username or e-mail o whatever string you want. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identicon) an identicon is

>  a visual representation of a hash value, usually of an IP address, that serves to identify a user of a computer system as a form of avatar while protecting the users' privacy.

There are various generators for Identicons out there and when building a powerful program with **Java** you may want to add a bit of an extra for your users. So instead of having one basic image for every user after signup you could use an Identicon. According to [Jdenticon](http://jdenticon.com/) it is a

> free Javascript library for generating highly recognizable identicons.

And the Identicons are very nicely generated and can be generated as *.svg*-files. Unfortunately **JDenticon** is written in *javascript* and can't be used in **Java** without some other code.
